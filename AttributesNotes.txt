- Named option -> can have default value
- Positional argument -> can have default value
- Both
- Bool property with a switch -> Does this make sense?


Attributes validator
==========================
- Default value of different type than property -> fail
- Switch values (when present and when not present) of different type than property -> fail
- Cames cannot clash - long and short names
